# PBJ-Nurses-Staffing-Analysis
These dataset is based on data submitted by long-term care facilities through the Payroll Based Journal (PBJ) system.

**INTRODUCTION:** 

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) provides publicly available datasets, known as the Payroll Based Journal Public Use Files (PBJ PUFs), which offer detailed daily data on nursing home staffing levels and resident census information. These datasets are based on data submitted by long-term care facilities through the Payroll Based Journal (PBJ) system. The PBJ system requires facilities to report accurate and complete direct care staffing details, including those for agency and contract staff, in a standardized, verifiable format. Facilities must submit the paid hours worked by each staff member for every day, along with resident census data sourced from the Minimum Data Set (MDS). This initiative ensures transparency and supports analysis of staffing patterns in nursing homes.

**OBJECTIVES:**

**Understand Staffing Patterns:**
* Identify trends and patterns in staffing levels across various facilities, states, or ownership types.

**Correlate Staffing with Resident Census:**

* Analyze the relationship between daily resident census (patient count) and the staffing hours provided, ensuring that resources align with patient care needs.

**Identify Anomalies:**

* Detect outliers or facilities with unusually high or low staffing levels compared to their resident census, which might indicate inefficiencies or potential care gaps.

**Support Transparency and Accountability:**

* Use the findings to help stakeholders understand the accuracy and effectiveness of reported staffing data and align it with CMS standards.

**Guide Resource Allocation:**

* Provide actionable insights for improving staffing distribution to optimize patient care and facility operations.

**Monitor Compliance with Regulations:**

* Check if facilities meet CMS requirements for submitting payroll-based data on direct care staffing and maintaining consistent care standards.
