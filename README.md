These dataset is based on data submitted by long-term care facilities through the Payroll Based Journal (PBJ) system.

**INTRODUCTION:** 

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) provides publicly available datasets, known as the Payroll Based Journal Public Use Files (PBJ PUFs), which offer detailed daily data on nursing home staffing levels and resident census information. These datasets are based on data submitted by long-term care facilities through the Payroll Based Journal (PBJ) system. The PBJ system requires facilities to report accurate and complete direct care staffing details, including those for agency and contract staff, in a standardized, verifiable format. Facilities must submit the paid hours worked by each staff member for every day, along with resident census data sourced from the Minimum Data Set (MDS). This initiative ensures transparency and supports analysis of staffing patterns in nursing homes.
